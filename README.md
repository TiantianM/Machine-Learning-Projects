# Machine-Learning-Projects

This course is designed to introduce students to the field of machine learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This class will present a number of important modeling and prediction techniques that are staples in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science (more broadly). In addition, this course will cover the statistical underpinnings of common methods.
